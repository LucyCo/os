EX: 2

FILES:
README      - this file.
utheads.cpp - implementation for library of functions which are designed to run multiple thread 
handler according to given quantum amount.
makefile    - make file for compilation of this project.

REMARKS:

ANSWERS:
Answer to question 1:
(rr) pro - each thread gets the same quantum so the small tasks will be able to make some progress.
con â€“ if we have tasks with equal runtime, then we have no gain in running them with RR.
(pq) pro - tasks with higher priority will get done faster.
con - there is a chance that threads with lower priority will wait a long time before they get to run.
In our implementation, threads have the same quantum but different priorities, so threads with higher 
priorities will be done faster. so we gain from having the same quantum.

Answer to question 2:
A user level event could be printing a word (or any I/O event), which will imply blocking the current 
thread and resuming when it is done.
